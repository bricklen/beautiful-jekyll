### About Me

A resident of Vancouver Island, and an ardent fan of Postgres. I'm a Postgres DBA by choice and by trade, so it would be strange if I wasn't a big supporter of PostgreSQL. Along with Postgres, I enjoy exploring the ecosystem around the database with regards to data flows and automation (in Linux, primarily).
Outside of work, I am a faspitch softball pitcher, a rugby fan (ex-player), and a fan of most sports.

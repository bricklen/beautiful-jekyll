### About me

Born and bred Vancouver Islander who is a big fan of Postgres (I'm a Postgres DBA, it would be weird if I wasn't a huge fan, eh?). 
Outside of work, I am a faspitch softball pitcher, a rugby fan (ex-player), and spend too much time taking turns with my wife chastising our cats and dogs for getting up to no end of mischief.
